TODO:

slightly different float rounding for python2 and 3

fix trigger

fix behavior on "rx failed"

detect mega (or clock speed) and adjust accordingly?

make sure num_imus doesn't change for one dataset

clean up imports

better default save directory

still need arduino to stop immedietly on trigger

ASA
disable record button during test   ( DIFFICULT )
text window breaks when it gets too full
tests:
    imus self-test
    magnetometer

MAYBE:
auto-detect mag
