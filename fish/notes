    calls refreshes on cancel
    can click 'process' button even if no data loaded
    breaks (no trigger read) if empty

can't find arduino on windows

when fail to start due to trigger, tell user why

more tooltips 

JERRY TEST:
buffer: print seconds too
legend line colors
trigger state indicator

better mutex

replot after process

global class:
    last search path
    disable/enable format

cant plot for very long...

segfault on exit with python3

when loading file, check for correctness

fix behavior on "rx failed"

detect mega (or clock speed) and adjust accordingly?

make sure num_imus doesn't change for one dataset

better default save directory


ASA
