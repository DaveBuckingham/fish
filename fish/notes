TODO:

toggle units:
    m/s^2 vs Gs for accelerometer
    radians/sec vs degs/sec for gyro

update author names in setup.py

am_data.py line 65, change assert to error message
am_rx.py line 384, error message

COMMENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

manual: discuss timestamp (pc receive time. capture time = 200/s by arduino clock)

what happens if recording starts with trigger on? make sure
its correct in the manual

fewer messages in textbox

downsample plotting data when it gets big so no slowdown

test port detection on windows

process:
    calls refreshes on cancel
    can click 'process' button even if no data loaded
    breaks (no trigger read) if empty

can't find arduino on windows

when fail to start due to trigger, tell user why

more tooltips 

better mutex

global class:
    last search path
    disable/enable format

when loading file, check for correctness

fix behavior on "rx failed"

detect mega (or clock speed) and adjust accordingly?

make sure num_imus doesn't change for one dataset

better default save directory

ASA
disable record button during test   ( DIFFICULT )
text window breaks when it gets too full
tests:
    imus self-test
    magnetometer


DONE

need to include in documentation: random trigger values if unplugged.

replot after process
