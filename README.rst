PROGRAM_NAME is an application for recording and processing data from inertial
measurement units (IMUs). It consists of two parts. Microcontroller code running
on an Arduino board collects data from the IMUs and transmits it to a PC. A
Python program running on the PC receives data from the Arduino and provides
users with a graphical interface. This interface allows users to interact with
the Arduino and to view and manipulate IMU data.

Assume 5th derivitive of position is 0,
i.e. accelerations are piecewise linear.
