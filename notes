TODO:
some easier way to set trigger delay.
bigger record button, on top.
implement tests.
realtime frequency report (e.g over 50 samples)
smoother plots? update frequently with translation
text window breaks when it gets too full
tests: arduino com, imus com, imus self-test, magnetometer

MAYBE:
read "trigger" state instead of define.
seems like data collection warmup delay only works on first collection
auto-detect mag
