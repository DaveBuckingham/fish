TODO2:
message when stop recording.
read "trigger" state instead of define.
behave well when trigger already on.
some easier way to set trigger delay.
bigger record button, on top.
implement tests.
realtime frequency report (e.g over 50 samples)
smoother plots? update frequently with translation



BUGS:
text window breaks when it gets too full
seems like data collection warmup delay only works on first collection


TODO:
communication hand shake at connect
implement pre-trigger delay
tests: arduino com, imus com, imus self-test, magnetometer
replace sentinels (longer?), or generally better system for com with arduino?
move all plots and their labels to a separate widget
    what else can we move out of am_gui?
READ -> REG 39 GROUPING

mag whoami
load up data in fifo, then average it when we read?



FILES:

am_gui.py
main program.
includes am_plot.py, am_rx.py, am_settings.py

am_plot.py
module for plotting data.
i.e. one of the 4 plot windows.

am_rx.py
module for com with arduino.

am_settings.py
module for program settings.

am_tx
directory containing my arduino code and the timer library it uses.

fish_rx.py
this was the first program i wrote for reading data from the arduino.
writes plain text to stdout.
not used by gui.
